# Activity Binary Search Tree Project

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a binary search tree (BST) specialized for scheduling and managing activities. The project is structured into two main files:

1. `ActivityBST.h`: This header file defines the structure of the binary tree nodes (`tree_node`) and declares the `ActivityBST` class. Each node represents an activity with a specific time and description.

2. `ActivityBST.cpp`: The implementation file provides the functionalities of the `ActivityBST` class, including methods for inserting, deleting, and retrieving activities based on time. It also includes utility functions for time formatting and validation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Basic knowledge of terminal or command prompt usage

### Compiling the Code
To compile the project, navigate to the directory containing the source files and use a C++ compiler like g++.

```bash
g++ ActivityBST.cpp -o activityScheduler


Features

Insert activities with specific times into the BST.
Delete activities based on time.
Retrieve and display activities in a time-ordered manner.
Time input validation and formatting.
